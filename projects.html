            Using an Arduino Pro Micro clone and a male mirco USB to male USB connector, I created a USB Rubber Ducky. A "Rubber Ducky" is a Keystroke Injection Attack platform which can do anything you can do with a keyboard. So you could do anything from changing a wallpaper to finding valuable data on a victims computer. I got the idea from Hak5's USB Rubber Ducky, but it was quite expensive for $50. I made this one for only about $10 and it works exactly the same except I have to convert Hak5's DuckyScipt into Arduino code, which is really easy to do using Nuurl's Duckuino DuckyScript to Arduino converter. I am trying to 3D print a case for the Pro Micro so it is more descrete and can be used with no suspicion.
